## Asteroids

In this game, the player/players is tasked with avoiding asteroids for as long as possible. The player controls spaceship
using the arrow keys (if there is a second player they use wasd) and will lose when crashing into an asteroid. 

## Concepts
We started out by using a combination of confettify and in-class activity code to create a menu screen, two game screens, and an end screen.
We heavily modified some runner code for collision detection, and for creating the spaceship.
NOTE: You may spawn directly on top of an asteroid and die immediately. Inheritance concepts were also implemented from Module 2.

#### Operating System: Windows and MacOs
When running the program ensure that the freeglut.dll file is copied into the cmake-debug folder.
